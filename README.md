## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŽ“ I am a forward-thinking, open-minded individual with a strong passion for personal and professional growth. With over 5-yearsâ€™ experience of partnership development in higher education, I have had the privilege of contributing to the success of highly-internationalized training institutions. This journey has not only honed my skills in fostering cross-cultural business understanding and collaboration but also ignited an aspiration within me â€“ to advance into the dynamic field of business analytics.

ðŸŒ± Recognizing the transformative power of data-driven insights, I am now actively pursuing opportunities to upskill myself to leverage data analytics for impactful decisions that enhance business offerings and cooperation. My goal is to contribute to a more informed and interconnected business landscape.
